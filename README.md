# Transformers For Vision

A structured learning and implementation repository covering modern vision transformers and multimodal AI, including handwritten notes, experiments, and end-to-end projects from ViT to multimodal LLMs.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey through **Transformers for Vision** from Vizuara.  
It combines **conceptual understanding** with **practical implementation**, focusing on how transformer-based architectures are applied to real-world computer vision, video, and vision–language problems.

The goal of this repo is twofold:
- Serve as a **personal knowledge base** for long-term reference
- Act as a **central index** to larger, production-oriented projects built during this journey
